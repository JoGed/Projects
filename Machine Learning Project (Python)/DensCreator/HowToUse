Create Densities via:
python -u DensCreator.py 12345 1 1-3 g > DensOut.log 2>&1 

- 12345 -> index
- 1     -> number of external potentials (per .csv file)
- 1-3   -> Dens computed for 1-3 particles (I recommend to keep "1-3" if you want to compute the (fractional) xc potentials,
           otherwise i do not know what is going to happen)
- g     -> ground state (excited states not available, sorry)

To change parameters (e.g. system size, resolution) look into the DensCreator.py file



if Plots desired:
python SimpleRowPlotterLatexSpin.py DensSets/DensData_12345.csv 2 d p

d -> dens 
p -> external pot
