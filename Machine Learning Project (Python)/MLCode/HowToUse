A data set is needed for the ML training & testing.
Create a trainings set (.csv format) described in the HowToUse files
in the VxcCreator and DensCreator folders respectively.

Use the Prepare.py program to transform the trainings set (as .cvs file) into pickeled
dictionary containing pytorch tensors, e.g.:

python Prepare.py --name=12345 --data_dir=TrainingsSet/TrainingsSet_12345.csv

The .gz can eventually be used as a
data set file for the training & testing (via train.py and test.py)

To run the train.py and test.py properly we refer to the README on github.
