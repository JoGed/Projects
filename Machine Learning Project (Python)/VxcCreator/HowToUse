Create Vxc's based on information in a data file - e.g. DensData_12345.csv - which
is has to be saved in a DensSets folder (look into the DensCreator folder for a 
detailed description how to compute the densities via octopus).

Type:

python -u V_xc_CreatorSpin.py 12345 1.5*1e-8 1e-4 g > VxcOut.log 2>&1 

- 12345    -> index
- 1.5*1e-8 -> MSE max (treshold for convergence)
- 1e-4     -> max{|Dens|} (treshold for convergence)
- g        -> ground state (excited states not available, sorry)

IMPORTANT: if fractional densities are desired - e.g. 0.3' and 0.5' fractionals - change "alpha = np.array([1.])" in 
V_xc_CreatorSpin.py to "alpha = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 1.])"


if Plots desired:
python SimpleRowPlotterLatexSpin.py TrainingsSets/TrainingsSet_12345.csv 2 t p

t -> dens + Vxc
p -> external pot
